
Question - 
bid_amount: Coefficient = 0.8
time_to_bid: Coefficient = -0.4
ad_unit_A: Coefficient = 0.3 (reference category: ad_unit_B)


Answer - 
bid_amount = 0.8 means incresing the bid_amount by 1 unit will increse the log odds of winning the bid by 0.8. it shows the stronges positive impact

time_to_bid =  it is negetive means as you take more time to bid your chances gets decrease also it you increse the time by 1 unit it will decrease the log odds of winning the bid by 0.4

ad_unit_A = as you can see by positive sign it increse the log odds of winning the b incresing since the value is very less means it do not have much larger impact by varing the value. its imac

the incresing the log odds can be interpreted by =  log(p/(1-p)) =  w0 + 0.8 * bid amount -0.4*time_to_bid + 0.3*ad_unit_A
p is the probability of winning adds
